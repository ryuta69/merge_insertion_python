## Merge Insertion (Ford-Johnson algorithm)

I have never seen python's implementation of this algorithm, so created this.

## Thanks

The best repository to understand what's doing in this algorithm.

Unfortunately, the last section of the image looks wrong, you should insert 6 just after process 4, however, it's easy to understand.
